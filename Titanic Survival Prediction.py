# # Project: Titanic Survival Prediction

# ## Objective:
#  - The objective of the model is to predict whether passengers on the Titanic would have survived, based on features like passenger class, sex, age, number of siblings/spouses, parents/children on board, fare, and port of embarkation. This model could help us understand the factors that contributed to the likelihood of survival during the Titanic disaster.
# 
#  - Understanding these factors can provide insights into societal hierarchies and emergency response behaviors relevant to current maritime safety protocols.

# ## Dataset:
# The Titanic dataset found on the Kaggle website: (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)

# ## Tools Needed:
# 
# Python
# 
# Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
# 
# Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

# ### Step 1: Define the Problem
# "The Titanic disaster is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. In this project, we aim to analyze what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we'll apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy."

# ### Step 2: Data Collection
# #### Objective: 
#  - Our goal here is to load the Titanic dataset into a pandas DataFrame to prepare for exploratory data analysis and feature engineering. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle, which includes various features that may influence the survival rate of passengers.
# 
#  - Our goal here is to ingest the Titanic dataset into a pandas DataFrame, setting the stage for subsequent analysis. This dataset, sourced from Kaggle, features passenger information that could have affected survival rates during the sinking.

# ## Data Dictionary
# 
# Below is the description of each variable present in the Titanic dataset:
# 
# | Variable  | Definition                                   | Key                                             |
# |-----------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
# | `Survived`  | Whether the passenger survived              | 0 = No, 1 = Yes                                 |

# | `Sex`       | The sex of the passenger                    |  0 = Male, 1 = Female                            |
# | `Age`       | Age in years                                 |                                                 |
# | `SibSp`     | Number of siblings/spouses aboard           |                                                 |

num_rows, num_columns = train_data.shape
print(f"Loaded dataset contains {num_rows} rows and {num_columns} columns.")


# ## Step 3: Data Wrangling and Preprocessing

# ### Drop Irrelevant Features:
# 
# #### Objective:
#  - Dropping features like PassengerId, Name, Ticket, and Cabin is because they are unique identifiers that are unlikely to have a direct effect on survival, or that they contain a high percentage of missing values that are difficult to impute meaningfully.
# 

# In[1317]:


# Remove features unlikely to influence survival outcomes or with excessive missing data
train_data = train_data.drop(columns = ['PassengerId', 'Name', 'Ticket', 'Cabin'], axis = 1)
train_data.head()


# ### Handle missing values
# 
# #### Objective: 
#  - Address missing data to prevent model biases and errors, ensuring more reliable and accurate predictions.

# In[1318]:


# Fill missing 'Age' data with the median value to minimize the impact of outliers
train_data['Age'] = train_data['Age'].fillna(train_data['Age'].median())

# Assuming most passengers embarked from 'S' (Southampton), we fill missing values with 'S'
train_data['Embarked'] = train_data['Embarked'].replace(np.nan, 'S')


# ### Type Casting Age to Integer:
# 
# #### Objective:
#  - Convert the 'Age' feature from float to integer for consistency and to facilitate age-based grouping, enhancing the interpretability for categorical analysis.

# In[1319]:


# Ensure there are no missing values before casting
if train_data['Age'].isnull().any():
    train_data['Age'].fillna(train_data['Age'].median(), inplace=True)

# Cast 'Age' to integers for consistency in analysis and modeling
train_data['Age'] = train_data['Age'].astype(int)


# ### Convert Categorical Data into Numerical:
# 
# #### Objective: 
#  - Machine learning algorithms work with numerical inputs. Convert 'Sex' to a numerical category to align with model requirements.

# In[1320]:


# Convert 'Sex' into a numerical category: 0 for male and 1 for female
train_data['Sex'] = train_data['Sex'].map({'male': 0, 'female': 1})


# In[1321]:


# Checking the conversion 
train_data.head()


# ### Categorization in Groups:
# 
# #### Objective: 
#  - Group 'Age' into categories to potentially reveal patterns in survival that aren't linearly correlated with age.

# In[1322]:


# Group 'Age' into categorical bins
train_data['Age'] = pd.cut(x=train_data['Age'], bins=[0, 5, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 100], labels = ['Infant', 'Teen', '20s', '30s', '40s', '50s', 'Elder'])


# In[1323]:


train_data.head()


# ## Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# 
# #### The goal of EDA is to understand the distributions of various features and their relationship to the target variable (Survived). This includes looking for patterns, anomalies, or relationships that could inform feature engineering and model selection.

# #### Visualizing the count of the features

# In[1324]:


fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 4, figsize=(20, 20))

# A count plot showing the distribution of survivors
sns.countplot(x='Survived', data=train_data, ax=ax[0,0])
ax[0,0].set_title('Survival Distribution')

sns.countplot(x = 'Pclass', data = train_data, ax=ax[0,1])
ax[0,1].set_title('Classes Distribution')

# A count plot showing the distribution of Sex
sns.countplot(x = 'Sex', data = train_data, ax=ax[0,2])
ax[0,2].set_title('Sex Distribution')

# A count plot showing the distribution of Age
sns.countplot(x = 'Age', data = train_data, ax=ax[0,3])
ax[0,3].set_title('Age Distribution')

# A count plot showing the distribution of Embarked
sns.countplot(x = 'Embarked', data = train_data, ax=ax[1,0])
ax[1,0].set_title('Embarked Distribution')

# A count plot showing the distribution of Fare
sns.histplot(x = 'Fare', data= train_data, bins=10, ax=ax[1,1])
ax[1,1].set_title('Fare Distribution')

# A count plot showing the distribution of Siblings
sns.countplot(x = 'SibSp', data = train_data, ax=ax[1,2])
ax[1,2].set_title('Siblings Distribution')

# A count plot showing the distribution of Parents
sns.countplot(x = 'Parch', data = train_data, ax=ax[1,3])
ax[1,3].set_title('Parents Distribution')

plt.tight_layout()


# ### Insights: 
#  - In Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the visualizations offer a wealth of insights into the Titanic dataset. 
#  - The count plots effectively illustrate the basic distributions of passengers' characteristics, such as survival status, class, sex, and age. 

# #### Visualizing the relationship between the features

# In[1325]:


# Set up the matplotlib figure
fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 4, figsize=(20, 20))

# Countplot for gender showing the survival count for each sex

ax[0, 0].set_title('Survival Distribution by Sex')

# Histogram for age showing the distribution of ages amongst survivors and non-survivors
sns.histplot(x='Age', hue='Survived', data=train_data, element='step', ax=ax[0, 1])
ax[0, 1].set_title('Age Distribution by Survival')

# Boxplot for fare against sex, colored by passenger class
sns.boxplot(x='Sex', y='Fare', hue='Pclass', data=train_data, ax=ax[0, 2])
ax[0, 2].set_title('Fare Distribution by Sex and Pclass')

# Barplot for number of siblings/spouses aboard showing the survival rate

sns.barplot(x='Parch', y='Survived', data=train_data, ax=ax[1, 0])
ax[1, 0].set_title('Survival Rate by Number of Parents/Children Aboard')

# Scatter plot for number of siblings/spouses vs. number of parents/children
sns.scatterplot(x='SibSp', y='Parch', hue='Survived', data=train_data, ax=ax[1, 1])
ax[1, 1].set_title('Survived by Number of Siblings/Spouses vs. Parents/Children')

# Violin plot for fare against embarked point
sns.violinplot(x='Embarked', y='Fare', data=train_data, ax=ax[1, 2])
ax[1, 2].set_title('Fare Distribution by Port of Embarkation')

# Point plot showing survival rate by passenger class
sns.pointplot(x='Pclass', y='Survived', data=train_data, ax=ax[1, 3])
ax[1, 3].set_title('Survival Rate by Passenger Class')

# Adjust the layout of the plots for better presentation
plt.tight_layout()


# ### Insights:
# 
#  - The second set of plots examining relationships between features digs deeper, uncovering intricate patterns.
#   - The 'Survival Distribution by Sex' plot, for instance, starkly highlights the better survival rates of females compared to males, which may reflect social norms during the Titanic era, prioritizing "women and children first" during emergency evacuations. 
#  - Similarly, the 'Classes Distribution' plot reveals potential socio-economic factors affecting survival, with first-class passengers more likely to survive, possibly due to better access to lifeboats or cabins closer to the deck.
#  - The 'Age Distribution by Survival' histogram shows a skew towards younger passengers among survivors, hinting at a possible age bias in survival rates. 
#  - In the 'Fare Distribution by Sex and Pclass' boxplot, we see that higher fares, which correlate with higher passenger classes, also correlate with survival, providing further evidence of socio-economic influence. 
#   - Additionally, the 'Survival Rate by Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard' and 'Survival Rate by Number of Parents/Children Aboard' bar plots suggest that passengers with one to three family members aboard had better survival chances than those traveling alone or with large families, which may indicate the importance of small support networks during the disaster.

# ### Conclusion of the Titanic Survival Prediction Project
# 
# After a thorough analysis and predictive modeling process, we have developed a machine learning model that predicts the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic with a noted accuracy. The final model, a Decision Tree Classifier, was chosen based on its performance metrics, which demonstrated the highest validation accuracy among the models tested, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and K-Nearest Neighbors.
# 
# The Decision Tree model was favored due to its balance of accuracy and interpretability. It performed well on the validation set and maintained performance consistency when predictions were made on new, unseen test data. This model captures the non-linear relationships and interactions between features, such as passenger class, sex, age, and family size, which are significant predictors of survival as per historical accounts.

# ### Key Findings:
# 
#  - Socio-economic Status: Higher class passengers had a higher likelihood of survival, which could be due to cabin location or prioritized access to lifeboats.
#  - Gender Bias: Females had a significantly higher survival rate, reflecting the historical "women and children first" policy during evacuations.
#  - Age Factor: Younger passengers, especially children, were more likely to survive, which aligns with the efforts made to save the most vulnerable.
#  - Family Size: Passengers with a small number of relatives aboard had a better chance of survival compared to those traveling alone or with large families.
#  
# The predictive model's insights could serve several purposes:
# 
#  - Historical Analysis: Provide a quantitative backing to historical narratives and social dynamics of the era.
#  - Safety Enhancements: Inform modern maritime safety protocols by understanding the factors that affected survival, helping to prioritize safety measures for vulnerable groups.
#  - Educational Tool: Serve as an educational case study on the application of machine learning to historical events.
#  - Further Research: Open avenues for more nuanced research into socio-demographic impacts on disaster outcomes.

# In conclusion, this project not only serves as a testament to the power of machine learning in extracting meaningful insights from historical data but also has the potential to contribute to safety and education. The model's predictions, while rooted in a tragic event, offer valuable lessons that resonate with current social and safety considerations.
