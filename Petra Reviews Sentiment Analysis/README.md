Petra Reviews AI ðŸŒŸ
Sentiment Analysis for Enhancing Tourism Insights

Overview
This project is an end-to-end AI application that uses sentiment analysis to classify visitor reviews of Petra, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. By leveraging advanced machine learning models and state-of-the-art technologies, this system delivers actionable insights to enhance tourism experiences and support informed decision-making.

Key Features
Sentiment Classification: Classifies visitor reviews into positive, neutral, or negative categories with high accuracy.
Model Optimization: Tested and fine-tuned multiple Hugging Face Transformers (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT) to achieve ~90% accuracy.
Interactive Web App: User-friendly interface for analyzing feedback and visualizing sentiment trends.
Containerized Deployment: Seamless deployment using Docker for reproducibility and portability.
Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chart.js, Font Awesome.
Backend: FastAPI, Jinja2, Pydantic.
Machine Learning:
Framework: PyTorch.
Transformers: BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and Twitter-RoBERTa for sentiment analysis.
Containerization: Docker for packaging and deploying the entire application.
Deployment: Hosted on Heroku for real-time access.
