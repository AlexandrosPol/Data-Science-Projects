# Endangered Species Classifier

## Overview
The **Endangered Species Classifier** is a web application that leverages deep learning to identify whether an uploaded image belongs to an **endangered species**. The goal is to promote environmental conservation by raising awareness about at-risk wildlife.

Users can upload images of animals, and the app will classify the species and provide a confidence score.

## Key Features
- **Image Classification**: Uses transfer learning with ResNet50 to classify animal species with high accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using Streamlit for easy interaction and visualization.
- **Custom Styling**: Includes responsive design and visually appealing layouts.

## Deployment
The application is deployed on **Heroku** and is accessible at:  
[Endangered Species Classifier](https://endangered-species-app-2024-626612794e72.herokuapp.com/)

## How to Use
1. **Visit the Web App**: Navigate to the Heroku link.
2. **Upload an Image**: Choose a JPG or PNG file of an animal to classify.
3. **View Results**: The app displays the predicted species and confidence score.

## Supported Species
The model currently supports the following species:
- Mammals: Tiger, Panda, Lion, Giraffe, etc.
- Birds: Eagle, Cheetah, etc.
- Reptiles: Crocodile, etc.

A complete list is available in the app's sidebar.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more species to expand the classification capabilities.
- Integrate geographical mapping to show species distribution and conservation status.
- Deploy on a cloud platform with larger datasets for better accuracy.
