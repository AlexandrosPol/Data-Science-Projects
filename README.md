## Installation
Ensure R and RStudio are installed. Most projects require the following R packages: `caret`, `ggplot2`, `cluster`, `arules`. Install them using:
```R```
install.packages(c("caret", "ggplot2", "cluster", "arules"))

## Running the Scripts
Explain how to run each script and what inputs are needed.

## Projects
## Projects
### Soil Data Clustering
This project applies k-means clustering to soil data from Northern Greece to identify patterns and inform better agricultural practices. [View the script](Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Soil%20Dataset%20-%20k%20means%20clustering.R).

### Market Basket Analysis
Using the apriori algorithm, this analysis uncovers association rules within a dataset of countries to understand global patterns and trends. [View the script](Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Countries%20Dataset%20-%20apriori%20algorithm.R).

### Abalone Age Prediction
This project utilizes linear regression and PCA to predict the age of abalones from physical measurements. [View the script](Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Abalone%20Dataset%20-%20linear%20regression%2Bpca.R).

## Results
The clustering project revealed three distinct soil types, each with unique characteristics. 
The market basket analysis highlighted key associations that can predict various country metrics. 
The abalone age prediction model achieved a mean squared error of x.xx, indicating a certain level of accuracy.

For more detailed findings, please refer to the individual scripts which contain comprehensive comments and results.
