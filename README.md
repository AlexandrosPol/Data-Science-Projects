## Installation
Ensure R and RStudio are installed. Most projects require the following R packages: `caret`, `ggplot2`, `cluster`, `arules`. Install them using:
```R
install.packages(c("caret", "ggplot2", "cluster", "arules"))

## Running the Scripts
Explain how to run each script and what inputs are needed.
